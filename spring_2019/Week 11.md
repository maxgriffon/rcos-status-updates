Last Week's Accomplishments
I finished all the test cases I wanted to do for the node class and I finished all the work I need to do for the presentation

This Week's Plan
Give out my presentation and finish up the final touches on the code
Anything Blocking?
Presentations are difficult because I don't love public speaking.
