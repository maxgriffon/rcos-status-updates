## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

This past week I got learned about typescript and JavaScript I did some code academy for JavaScript.
I completed the first part of the course. This helped me understand the differences
between typescript and JavaScript. I went to an rcos bonus day and I learned about
git this was very useful because I learned the basics of forking and committing.
I start to work on a Multiplexer and Demultiplexer class for OpenCircuits.


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

My goal is to try to finish the Multiplexer class and begin testing it. currently it is not
finished or complete enough to begin testing. There for it is difficult to see if I have
any bugs. I also hope to finish most of the javaScript course on codeacademy and become more
familiar with the language.  
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.

It was difficult to adapt to the new language so I was not sure at first what to do
but I am beginning to understand. I also had a hard getting into the course so that
delayed my start.
