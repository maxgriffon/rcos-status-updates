## Last Week's Accomplishments

Worked on the render function for the muultiplexer and demultiplexer and finished and debugged the depultiplexer class

## This Week's Plan
Finish both the render and the demultiplexer class and debugg everything and test it and make a pull request for the code
 
## Anything Blocking?

I had to figure out how the render function worked and Had to figure out how to use my terminal better.
