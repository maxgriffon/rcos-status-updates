## Last Week's Accomplishments
I finished the Demultiplexer class and finished the render function and I have officially made a pull request with the new code

## This Week's Plan
Fine tune the new code and begin working on a new issue and help build the encoder and decoder class. Also take a course on Git.   
## Anything Blocking?
It was difficult because I am not very experienced in git so it was difficult to make a pull request.
