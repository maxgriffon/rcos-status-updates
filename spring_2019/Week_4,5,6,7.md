Last Week's Accomplishments
For week four I worked on an enhancement where when clicking the shift botton and drag an item you move on the grid lines.  
Then for week five I worked on a very similar concept except with rotation instead. Whenever the shift key is held and you rotate you 
rotate only 45 degrees. 
Then for week 6 I worked on deletion, and deselection I add in the ability to delete everything selected after you press the delete button
or the backspace. I did a similar thing with the escape key and deselecting everything.
For week 7 and the end of week 6 I worked on duplication I made it possible to duplicate an item at a position by pressing a space bar 
when it is begining dragged around. 
This Week's Plan
For week 8 my goal is to continue debugg issues and possibly start work on the electrical circuit creater that out team leader wants to try
to implement. 
Anything Blocking?
It was difficult because I am not very experienced in git so it was difficult to make a pull requests
I ran into some issues when trying to do the duplication because in the code the spacebar had certain unique characteristics which 
would the entire duplication process off
Notes 
Sorry for not doing this sooner.
