Last Week's Accomplishments 
For week 8 I finished working on the ground work of the Node class created more test cases 
Then for week 9 I ran into some issue with atom and spent a lot of time fixing that issue and learning more about atom once it final worked I finished up the node class and the test classes 
Then for week 10 I worked on the presentation I continued to work with the node class and did some research on certain Electrical Engineering concepts  
This Week's Plan For week 11 my goal is to continue workeing on the node class and see if I can try to get it to work better than it currently is. 
Anything Blocking? 
I had a very hard time with atom. It was broken for a little less than a week I had to complete uninstall everything and erase all the original files and install it again. I also was sick 
for a large amount of the week.
